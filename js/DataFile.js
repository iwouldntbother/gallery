I have always been fascinated with the translation between the two, the way they can cross over through to the digital realm and back to the material world with little resistance and what this means for the fate of an object. With the likes of 3D printing and CNC machines becoming more commonplace what does this mean for analog makers? Is the handmade something that will always be a respected method of creating? What will the human relationship to the digital world look like in times to come? The works centre around a 1 or 2 meter wooden baton. This rigid piece of wood, that has been faded and distorted in a lot of the pieces is a demonstration of the distance that should be observed when social distancing. I wanted to ask the question of what makes social distancing social, by creating objects that when viewed in a physical space would enforce distance between people which in the digital world is of no consequence.",

        about: "Through this project looking at the relationship between nostalgia and the internet, I looked at the development of symbols (often commercial) that become iconic to nostalgia through their role in the internet, the most memorable of which for me was the Microsoft Paint programme window. These symbols seem to be brought back or referenced in post-internet art that I saw, some things even coming back in trend in pop culture. This is common, we often see decades’ fashion and iconography resurging in later years but this seems to be the first time we’ve seen these nostalgic throwback trends come from a time post-internet, and also the first time in my life I’ve been around for both the original time and the resurgence, which I found very interesting. The way we document memories has changed, going from ephemera like ticket stubs to film cameras, but now we tend to hyper-document, taking dozens of photos at each event, even each moment, to the point where you can sense time passing between each snap of a single moment, as opposed to the couple of photos from a whole event that you might used to have. I’m fascinated with the dichotomy between the tangible and sensory way of documenting memories and the newer digital wave of hyper-documentation, and how these two ideas can interact and change each other.",
