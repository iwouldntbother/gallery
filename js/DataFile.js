        about: "Through this project looking at the relationship between nostalgia and the internet, I looked at the development of symbols (often commercial) that become iconic to nostalgia through their role in the internet, the most memorable of which for me was the Microsoft Paint programme window. These symbols seem to be brought back or referenced in post-internet art that I saw, some things even coming back in trend in pop culture. This is common, we often see decades’ fashion and iconography resurging in later years but this seems to be the first time we’ve seen these nostalgic throwback trends come from a time post-internet, and also the first time in my life I’ve been around for both the original time and the resurgence, which I found very interesting. The way we document memories has changed, going from ephemera like ticket stubs to film cameras, but now we tend to hyper-document, taking dozens of photos at each event, even each moment, to the point where you can sense time passing between each snap of a single moment, as opposed to the couple of photos from a whole event that you might used to have. I’m fascinated with the dichotomy between the tangible and sensory way of documenting memories and the newer digital wave of hyper-documentation, and how these two ideas can interact and change each other.",
